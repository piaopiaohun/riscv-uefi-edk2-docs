# RISC-V EDK2 Port Introduction
***

## RISC-V EDK2 Package

The branch (RISC-V-V2) on edk2-staging repository is RISC-V edk2 port with RISC-V
OpenSbi (https://github.com/riscv/opensbi) library integrated.
RiscVPkg provides the generic and common modules of RISC-V processors, while RiscVPlatformPkg provides common modules for RISC-V platforms.

```
RiscVPkg       - RISC-V processor package. This package provides RISC-V
                 processor related protocols/libraries accroding to UEFI
                 specification and edk2 implementations.
               - Opensbitypes.h under RiscVPkg/Include is the OpenSBI external definitions for EDK2 framework,
                 which leverages the macro OPENSBI_EXTERNAL_SBI_TYPES to use EDK2 type definitions.

RiscVPlatformPkg  - RISC-V platform package. This package provides RISC-V platform common modules, libraries,
                    PCDs and definitoins.
```

## RISC-V EDK2 Platform Packages

The branch (devel-riscvplatforms) on edk2-platforms repository is RISC-V platforms port which incorporate with RiscVPkg and RiscVPlatformPkg.
Two edk2 RISC-V platforms are currently introduced in this branch,
```
FreedomU500VC707Board       - SiFive Freedome U500 platform whcih is maintained under Platform/SiFive/U5SeriesPkg.

FreedomU540HiFiveUnleashedBoard  - SiFive Freedome U540 HiFive Unleashed platform whcih is maintained under
                                   Platform/SiFive/U5SeriesPkg.
```


Refer to Platform/SiFive/U5Series/Readme.md on edk2-platform repository.

## Toolchain of RISC-V EDK2 port
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
You have to clone the toolchain from above link and follow the installation
guidance mentioned in README.md for building RISC-V edk2 port.

This toolchain has been tested on below Linux distribution,
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS
Release:        16.04
GCC 9.2.0 is currently supported in RISC-V GNU toolchain.

Build issues may happen on other Linux distributions and have not been discovered
due to it is out of edk2 RISC-V contribution scope.

## EDK2 Build Target
"RISCV64" ARCH is the RISC-V architecture which currently supported and verified.
The verified RISC-V toolchain is https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
and the toolchain tag is "GCC5" which is declared in tools_def.txt.
Below is the edk2 build options for building RISC-V RV64 platform,
```
build -a RISCV64 -p Platform/{Vendor}/{Platform}/{Platform}.dsc -t GCC5
```
For example,
```
build -a RISCV64 -p Platform/SiFive/U5SeriesPkg/FreedomU500VC707Board/U500.dsc
-t GCC5
```

Make sure RISC-V toolchain is built successfully and the toolchain binaries are generated in somewhere you specified when building toolchain.
'GCC5_RISCV64_PREFIX' is the cross compilation prefix to toolchain binaries.
For example, set 'GCC5_RISCV64_PREFIX' to '~/RiscVToolchain/riscv64-unknown-elf-'
before you build RISC-V edk2 port.
